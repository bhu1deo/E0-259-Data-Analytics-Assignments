# E0-259-Data-Analytics-Assignments

This Repo contains interesting data analytics assignments that I worked on in my course E0 259 Data Analytics at IISC. 

1.) Mars Orbit Model: How well does a circle explain Mar's orbit?

2.) DLS Predictor: The next time you have a rain interruption, don't wait for the DLS score! DYI!

3.) Covid-19: Third wave, when are you coming?
